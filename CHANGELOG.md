# v11.0.dev7

This release follows a major overhaul of Kubetools - most notably moving all of the server/build logic down into this library (to deprecate/remove the server). The `kubetools` command can now deploy direct to Kubernetes.

- **Migration to client-only** (no more server), meaning new/changed commands:
    + `kubetools deploy <namespace> <app_path> [<app_path>...]`
    + `kubetools remove <namespace> [<app>...]`
    + `kubetools restart <namespace> <app>`
    + `kubeotols cleanup <namespace>`
    + `kubetools show <namespace> [<app>]`
    + Commands removed:
        * `kubetools wait`
        * `kubetools list *`
        * `kubetools job *`
- **Remove Python 2 support**
- Uses `kubeconfig` and Kubernetes contexts
- Correctly uses Kubernetes deployment objects for proper rolling updates
    + This also adds rollback compatability
- Improved replica control in `kubetools.yml`:
    + `deployments.NAME.minReplicas` (max exists already)
    + `deployments.NAME.replicaMultiplier`
- Support deployment strategy in `kubetools.yml`:
    + `deployments.NAME.updateStrategy` -> K8s `Deployment.spec.strategy`
- Add `--shell` argument to `ktd enter`
